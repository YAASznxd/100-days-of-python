# Day 2 Project: Tip Calculator

## Description
This is a simple tip calculator program written in Python. The program calculates how much each person needs to pay when splitting a bill, including the tip.

## How it works
- The user enters the total bill amount.
- The user chooses the tip percentage (10%, 12%, or 15%).
- The user enters the number of people to split the bill.
- The program calculates the total bill including tip.
- Then it divides the total by the number of people.
- Finally, it rounds the amount each person should pay to 2 decimal places and displays it.

## Example
If the bill is $150, split between 5 people, with a 12% tip, each person pays: (150 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6


## How to run
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Input the requested values when prompted.
3. See the amount each person needs to pay.
