# Day 4 Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Description
A simple Python implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where you play against the computer.  
The program uses ASCII art to make the game more visually appealing.

## How it works
1. The user is prompted to choose:
   - `0` for Rock
   - `1` for Paper
   - `2` for Scissors
2. The computer randomly chooses one of the three options.
3. The program compares choices and decides the winner:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
4. The winner is displayed, or the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- ASCII art for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- Randomized computer choices.
- Input validation for incorrect choices.


## How to run
1. Save the script as `rock_paper_scissors.py`.
2. Run the script in a terminal or Python IDE:
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
