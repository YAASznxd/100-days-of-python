# Treasure Island - Text Adventure Game

## Description
A simple text-based adventure game where the player makes choices to find the treasure. Depending on the decisions, the player either wins or meets a game over scenario.

## How it works
- The player starts at a crossroad and chooses to go "left" or "right".
- Choosing "left" leads to a lake with options to "wait" for a boat or "swim" across.
- Waiting safely brings the player to an island with three colored doors: red, yellow, and blue.
- Choosing the yellow door leads to the treasure and winning the game.
- Other choices result in game over messages.

## How to play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts by typing your choices.
3. Try to find the treasure by making the correct sequence of decisions.
